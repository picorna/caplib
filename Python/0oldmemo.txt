Note 1: Comments on the previous program "caplib_bak.py"
Figure 6 in the CAPLIB article (S.Yoneda et al., ACSOmega, 2018) was produced using the older file, "caplib_bak.py".
"caplib_bak.py calls the C program "caplib5.c" via the "ctypes" library of Python.
Thus "caplib5.c" is compiled as follows (if necessary, change "cc" to other C compilers),
	cc -fpic -c capgen5.c
	cc -shared capgen5.o
	rm capgen5.o
	mv a.out capgen5.so
However, we found that the "ctypes" library does not always work correctly in some PC or PyMOL, although works well on our Mac.
Thus, "caplib_bak.py" was fully revised into "caplib.py".
Everything is written in Python and "capgen5.c" is unnecessary.

Note 1b:
The above revision has a bad point: the Python script can not use all the functions of C programs.
This problem will be solved in future.

Note 2:
The "capgen" command in the previous "caplib_bak.py" contained a weak point:
The PDB file must be stored in the current directory of the PyMol console window, because the BIOMT lines must be read from the file.
Furthermore, the extention of the file is always assumed to be ".ent".
In the revised "caplib.py", you can give explicitly the PDB file name including the directory name.
With "caplib.py", for example, when you use capgen with PyMOL, write as follows, for example,
	capgen(1,"/Users/username/Desktop/somedirectory/pdb_file_name")
If the file name is omitted as follows,
	capgen(1)
then PyMOL tries to read the PDB file for reading BIOMT lines, in the current directory.
