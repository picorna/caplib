     Distance from a plane that is defined with its center and its orthogonal vector.
     In my simulation program, the distance from a restricted plane was calculated previously. That is, the plane was defined with
     the orthogonal vector, the center, and the two additional vectors that denote the two terminal lines of the plane.
     However, I adopt the distance as a simple definition between an atom and a infinetely wide plane herein, because the complicated
     previous definition is not related the calculational speed nor precision.
